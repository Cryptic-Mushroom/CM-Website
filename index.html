    <h1>Welcome to Cryptic Mushroom's Website!</h1>
    <p>Cryptic Mushroom is a new and emerging Minecraft modding team led by Cipher Zero X with the goal of making fresh and unique mods-mainly along the theme of adding new dimensions to the game.</p>
    <p>Founded in November 2017, we made our best efforts to get on our feet with different projects that didn't work out. In October 2018, we entered MMD's second annual SpookyJam with a brand new idea and new team members and made the earliest
      alpha
      version for The Midnight mod.</p>

    <h1>The Midnight</h1>
    <p>The Midnight is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a brand new dimension to explore full of unique adventures and dangers! It's a dimension of perpetual darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various flora, fungi
      and fauna of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly be dragged by a rifter into this strange, hostile world...</p>
